# contract-verifications

This repository runs a daily build-verification of Stellar contracts and records the results.

## How it works

A scheduled GitHub workflow ([`.github/workflows/verify.yml`](.github/workflows/verify.yml)) runs daily and:

1. Clones [`stellar-experimental/contract-wasms`](https://github.com/stellar-experimental/contract-wasms) and computes the sha256 of each `.wasm` in `contracts/`.
2. Skips any wasm that already has a record in `verifications/<hash>.json`.
3. For each remaining wasm, in an isolated matrix job with no token permissions:
   - Reads the wasm's contract metadata (looks up `source_repo` and `source_rev`).
   - Clones the source at that revision.
   - Runs `stellar contract build verify --wasm-hash <hash> --network mainnet --source <dir>` (from [stellar/stellar-cli#2525](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli/pull/2525)).
   - Uploads a JSON record as a workflow artifact.
4. A separate job collects the artifacts and commits them to `verifications/`.

## Record format

Each verification produces `verifications/<hash>.json`:

```json
{
  "wasm-hash": "...",
  "build-verified": true,
  "run": "https://github.com/.../actions/runs/...",
  "meta": { "...": "..." }
}
```

`build-verified` is `false` when the verify command fails (mismatch, missing `source_repo`/`source_rev` meta, or the source produces zero or multiple cdylibs). Records are written once and never re-checked — delete a record to force re-verification.
